Scary Go Round Downloader
=========

Purpose....
-----------
Was desperately wanting to read [Scary Go Round](http://scarygoround.com/sgr/) on my plane flight back to Minnesota on my Nook Book Color. So I decided to make a downloader to navigate through and download all of Scary Go Round and zip up each chapter into its own `.cbz` file. Which can be used with most comic readers. For Mac, see [Simple Comic](http://dancingtortoise.com/simplecomic/) or [Jomic](http://jomic.sourceforge.net/).

How to use...
-----------
A downloader tool for one of my favorite webcomics.

  - Run `bundle`
  - Run `bundle exec ruby getScaryGoRound.rb`
  - Answers the prompts accordingly
  - Enjoy all of Scary Go Round!

What this does....
-----------

This downloads the entirety of Scary Go Round from 2004-2009, when John Allison, god bless him, decided to move onto [Bad Machinery](http://www.scarygoround.com/)
